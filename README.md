# sd-forge-ic-light
A1111/SD Forge extension for [IC-Light](https://github.com/lllyasviel/IC-Light). Forge backend is based on https://github.com/huchenlei/ComfyUI-IC-Light-Native.

## [2024-06-06] Major Update [PR [#24](https://github.com/huchenlei/sd-forge-ic-light/pull/24)]

- Load models from `ic-light` folder with arbitrary filenames. You need to rename your `unet` folder to `ic-light`.
- Use the pre-built `rembg` package instead of diffusers version.
- **New Feature:** Implement *Difference of Gaussians* to reintroduce some details, e.g. text, after the processing.
- **New Feature:** Implement reinforce-fg option which allows better preservation of fg base color.

## Getting Started
0. For **Automatic1111**, install [sd-webui-model-patcher](https://github.com/huchenlei/sd-webui-model-patcher) first
1. Download the <ins>two</ins> models from [Releases](https://github.com/Haoming02/sd-forge-ic-light/releases)
2. Create a new folder, `ic-light`, inside your webui `models` folder
3. Place the 2 models inside the said folder
4. **(Optional)** You can rename the models, as long as the filenames contain either **`fc`** or **`fbc`**

## How to use
For best result, it is recommended to use low CFG and strong denosing strength.

### Given FG and light map, Genereate BG and relight [Img2Img]
Img2Img input image is lightmap. After you select value from the radio, the img2img input will automatically be set by the extension. You can also upload your own lightmap by selecting `Custom`.

### [2024-06-06] Restore Detail
Detail transfer was originally implemented in https://github.com/kijai/ComfyUI-IC-Light. It captures high frequency details, e.g. text, in the input fg image and reapplys them to the output image.

### [2024-06-06] Reinforce FG
A big problem of IC-Light is that it often alters the FG object's base color too much. By adding the fg image on top of the lightmap, this issue can be alleviated. This essentially implements this comfyui [workflow](https://github.com/huchenlei/ComfyUI-IC-Light-Native/blob/main/examples/ic_light_preserve_color.json).
Here is a comparison:

Without reinforce-fg: You can observe that the fg object almost looks transparent.

With reinforce-fg (Same seed): The fg object no longer look transparent.

### Skip remove bg
If the default remove bg cannot achieve your desired effect, you can use other tools to create an RGBA image and uncheck the remove bg checkbox. Image with grey background can also be used the same way as RGBA image.

## Known Issue

- `Restore Details` does not work properly when the input and output aspect ratios are different
